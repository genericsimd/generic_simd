The tests are dependent on google test framework.  Due to the
opensource license issue, we don't include it in our source tree.

Please download googletest framework first from
  https://code.google.com/p/googletest/
and unzip it into "tests/gtest-1.6.0" directory. 
Alternatively one can modify the "GTEST_DIR" value in 
tests/Makefile.
