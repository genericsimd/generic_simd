Make sure you have the access right to yktgsa projects/g/generic_simd directory.

Clone in a server that has direct gsa directory access
@code{.sh}
git clone /gsa/yktgsa/projects/g/generic_simd/gsimd.git gsimd
@endcode

Clone through a server that has gsa directory access.
@code{.sh}

@section sourcecode Source code structure
<ul>
<li><b>docs</b> Generate html docs through doxygen</li>
<li><b>examples</b> Examples using this library. </li>
<li><b>gtest-1.6.0</b> Google test framework used in unit test</li>
<li><b>include</b> The library source code</li>
<li><b>tests</b> Unit tests, test both vsx4 and generic4 implementation </li>
</ul>

@section runtest Run unit tests
The unit tests are in tests directory. The current unit test only covers power_vsx4.h.
@code{.sh}
$ cd tests
$ make test
@endcode
The test app will test vsx4 and generic4 interfaces, and generate the report.


@section gendoc Generate document 
Make sure you have doxygen installed.
@code{.sh}
$ cd docs
$ make
$ make publish #You must run publish in a server that has direct gsa directory access.
@endcode

@section ispc Working with ISPC
In order to use the library with ispc, please checkout gsimd project in the same directory as ipsc.
@code{.sh}
  .\gsimd
  .\ispc
@endcode
Then, you just goto ispc\examples\, and execute "TARGET=adapter4 make bench" to compile and run all benchmarks.

Or goto one example, e.g. noise, and execute either "TARGET=adapter4 make" or "make adapter4" to get it compiled.

The current adapter4 is connected to power_vsx4.h
