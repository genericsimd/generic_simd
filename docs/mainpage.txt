 @section overview Overview
 Generic SIMD Library provides C++ based simple interfaces to use SIMD intrinsics.
 
 The current implementation have short vector with lanes=4 support.
 Here lanes=4 means all the short vector data types in this library contain 
 4 scalar elements.
 A generic short vector library with lanes could be 2,4,8,16,32... is in developing.
 
 Here is the hello vector example using power vsx SIMD.
 
 @code{.cpp}
#include <iostream>
#include <power_vsx4.h> //SIMD Generic Library for power platform

using namespace vsx; //Name space for vsx interfaces

int main (int argc, char* argv[])
{
    svec4_f v1(1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4);
    svec4_f v2 = v1 * 2;
    std::cout << "Hello, " << v2 << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
 @endcode

Compile and run it.

@code{.sh}
$ g++ -I../../include HelloSIMD.cpp -mvsx -flax-vector-conversions -o HelloSIMD -Wno-int-to-pointer-cast
$ ./HelloSIMD
Hello, svec4_f[2.2, 4.4, 6.6, 8.8]
@endcode

The current implementation needs gcc to compile.
<ul>
<li>../../include contains the header files</li>
<li>-mvsx enable gcc support Power vsx SIMD</li>
<li>-Wno-int-to-pointer-cast -flax-vector-conversions not show warnings and enable vector casts</li>
</ul>

If you want to use another SIMD support, suppose the generic one (SIMD simulated by scalar code).
@code{.cpp}
#include <generic4.h>
using namespace generic; //Name space for generic interfaces
@endcode


@section datatypes Data Types
The current library has short vector types
<ul>
<li> bool (svec4_i1) </li>
<li> char (svec4_i8, svec4_u8) </li>
<li> short (svec4_i16, svec4_u16)</li>
<li> integer (svec4_i32, svec4_u32)</li>
<li> long long (svec4_i64, svec4_u64)</li>
<li> float (svec4_f) and double (svec4_d)</li>
</ul>
The "i" here means signed types, and "u" means unsigned types. 

In the following document we use VTYPE to express the short vector types, and
STYPE to express scalar types.

@section operation Operations

@subsection construction Short vector construction
<ul>
<li> Default constructor returns a vector with undefined value. e.g. "svec4_i32 v;" 
    You can modify it's elements by "[]" operator. </li>
<li> Construct a short vector with four scalar values. e.g. "svec4_i32 v(1,2,3,4)" </li>
<li> Construct a short vector with one scalar value. e.g. "svec4_i32 v(100)". 
All the four values in the short vector is 100. </li>
</ul>

@subsection access Access single element in the short vector
"[]" operator is used to get and set the elements.
@code{.cpp}
svec4_i32 v(1,2,3,4);
int a = v[2]; //a is 3 now.
v[3] = 10; //v is [1,2,3,10] now.
@endcode

Due to the current limitation, bool vector's setter must use "-1" as true in the right hand side.
@code{.cpp}
svec4_i1 m(0); //all elements are false
m[0] = -1; //m's first element is true.
@endcode

@subsection commonop Common operations
Here is a short list for common operations. 
Please refer the detail documents for all operations.

<h4> Load and Store </h4>
Store a vector to location p through instance method store (VTYPE *).

Load a vector from location p through class static method VTYPE::(VTYPE *).
e.g. "svec4_i32::load(an_address)" will return a new svec4_i32 vector.

Load a scalar value from an address and splat it into the whole vector could 
be done through class static method VTYPE::load_and_splat(STYPE *)

There is another method called VTYPE::load_const(STYPE*), which has similar semantics.

@subsection compare Compare Operations
Compare two vectors, and return a svec4_i1 vector.

Operators: == != for all types

Operators: >, >=, <, <= for all types except svec4_i1.

<h4> Bit operations </h4>
svec4_i1 has operator ~ to reverse the boolean value.

Binary bit operators &, |, ^ are available for all integer vector types.

@subsection math Math operations
Support all types except svec4_i1.

Unary operator "-" is used to get the neg value for non-boolean vectors

Binary operators +, -, *, / can support VTYPE op VTYPE, VTYPE op STYPE, STYPE op VTYPE.

Binary operators &gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;, % can support VTYPE op VTYPE, VTYPE op STYPE over
all integer types. 
&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt; for shift, and % for remainder.
Please not shift can only has unsigned integer vector in the right hand.

@subsection methodop Instance methods operations
broadcast(), rotate(), shuffle() support all types exclude svec4_i1().

round(), floor(), ceil(), sqrt(), rcp(), rsqrt(), exp(), log(), 
pow(VTYPE) support svec4_f, and svec4_d.

All above will return a new vector.

reduce_add(), reduce_max(), reduce_min() do a vector scope's reduction,
and return a scalar value.

any_true(), all_true(), none_true() do a svec4_i1 vector's reduction, and
return a boolean scalar value.

@subsection gather-scatter Gather and Scatter
Please refer the detail document for how to use gather and scatter.
E.g. svec4_i32 type
<ul>
<li>vsx::svec4_i8::gather()</li>
<li>vsx::svec4_i8::scatter()</li>
<li>vsx::svec4_i8::gather_base_offsets()</li>
<li>vsx::svec4_i8::scatter_base_offsets()</li>
</ul>
The current power processor has no gather/scatter instructions. So the software
based implementation is slow right now.

@subsection otherop Other Operations
@subsubsection fmaop Multiply-Add and Multiply-Sub</h4>
VTYPE svec_madd(VTYPE a, VTYPE b, VTYPE c) returns a * b + c;

VTYPE svec_msub(VTYPE a, VTYPE b, VTYPE c) returns a * b - c;

@subsubsection selectop Select operation
The prototype is svec_select(svec4_i1 mask, VTYPE a, VTYPE b), and return
a new vector whose elements are selected from a or b based on the mask.
True from a and false from b.

There is another select svec_select(bool cond, VTYPE a, VTYPE b), which
is the same as "cond ? a : b".

@subsubsection castop Type cast operation
The prototype is svec_cast<TO_VTYPE>(FROM_VTYPE). It supports all combinations
of type cast. Each element's cast semantics is the same as scalar cast.

@subsection maskedop Operation with mask
load, store, gatter, scatter, compare operations have a masked version.
Please refer the detail document for detail.
