@section perf Performance Evaluation

We have ported some examples from intrinsics implementation to Generic SIMD implementation, 
and evaluated their performance.

Applications include
<ul>
<li>RGB2Gray, float</li>
<li>Mandelbrot, float</li>
<li>SPSS-sweep, double</li>
<li>Dgemm, double</li>
<li>CVA-Mean, float</li>
</ul>

Some of them only have Power Platform intrinsics implementation, and some of them only have intel intrinsics implementation.
We compared the generic SIMD's performance with the intrinsics implementation by measure their speed up over scalar code.

We also evaluated the portability of our GSIMD library by running the generic SIMD version application on the 
platform without intrinsics implementation.

Below are the result.

The following figures show the performance speedup versus the scalar code on different platforms.

Higher is better.
