@section performance Performance Evaluation

The performance goal of the generic SIMD intrinsic library is to match
up with the performance of the same code written in a
platform-specific intrinsics. We have ported some examples from
intrinsics implementation to Generic SIMD implementation, and
evaluated their performance.

Applications include
<ul>
<li>RGB2Gray, float</li>
<li>Mandelbrot, float</li>
<li>SPSS-sweep, double</li>
<li>Dgemm, double</li>
<li>CVA-Mean, float</li>
</ul>

Some of them only have Power Platform intrinsics implementation, and
some of them only have intel intrinsics implementation.  We compared
the generic SIMD's performance with the intrinsics implementation by
measure their speed up over scalar code.

We also evaluated the portability of our Generic SIMD intrinsics
library by running the generic SIMD version application on the
platform without intrinsics implementation.

Below are the result.

The following figures show the performance speedup versus the scalar code on different platforms.

Higher is better.
