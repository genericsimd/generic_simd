@subsection fma_issue Multiply-add Multiply-sub's precision

The vsx's vsx::svec_madd(), vsx::svec_msub() are mapped into madd and msub intrinsics directly,
while generic::svec_madd, generic::svec_msub() is implemented by scalar code. 
There are rare cases that fused operation by one hardware instruction provides higher precision in float operations.

So it's possible the vsx and generic provide slightly different results.
